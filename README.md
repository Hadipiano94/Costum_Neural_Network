# Costum_Neural_Network
the idea is not mine. i got it from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk
<p>but I wrote everything from scratch, not looking at any code.
the dots in the picture are my creatures that have a very simple brain. the brain decides in which direction the creature should move. the brain is a list of cells with a list of cell relations. each cell does something to the data and lends it to the next cell until the "last cell" where the decision is executed.
<p>this is the environment:</p>

generations pass and the creatures evolve to make it to the red squere...
there are options for obstacles too.
